# About the Data
First of all, Tensorflow must read a draft which I gather data on. For that, I used [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to read my drafts. Also, the draft should be .csv file. That is the reason why I used Google Sheet to make .csv file that Tensorflow and Pandas can read the draft. You can see the datas at [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMR0-eyFT5Dln8N-7rrnY1rUEOE2V1K6vLw8oZPWs8o/edit?usp=sharing).
